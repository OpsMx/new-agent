AWS account configuration supporting files

authenticating-account : This is the configuration for the "primary" account or "managing" role
       user: We will need a "user" only if we are outside the AWS eco-system. Within the system,
             everything is accessible via "role" which loosely translates to a "system account".
             An EC2 instance can have a "role" (or roleS) that will authenticate and authorize
             access to all AWS resource based in the IAM logic. 
             EKS worker notes are basically EC2 instances. These notes can have a "role".
             So, if Spinnaker is running in an EKS cluster, a "user" is not required at all.
       assume-only-role: This file describes an example role that is given to "srini-nonroot-role"
             that can be configured as the "primary" account. However, ths account so configured
             cannot do ANYTHING excapt to "assume role" with which trust relation ships are established
             
target-account: This is the configuration for the account where deployment will be done
       ROL-Spinnaker-Managed-Role: This file describes the permissions(policy) and trust
             setup so that user/srini-nonroot is can assume this role and deploy. 
       srini-target-policy: This is the cleaned-up version with some of the stuff removed. This 
             represents the minimal version that a role must have to be able to deploy to EC2
             "srini-target-role" has been created in opsmx-account to test this
       BaseIamRole: This is the default.iamrole defined in the primary account. 
             Spinnaker uses this to get any permissions it may not get from the given role.
             Note that it does "assumerole" on the TARGET-Account i.e NOT on the primary account
             So, if we have multiple target-accounts, each of them needs to have this role. 

             Procedure: a) Go to EC2 dashboard b) Select Role c) Click "Create" d) In "Common use cases"
             click on EC2 and Next:Permissions e) Cick Next:Tags f) Click Next:Review g) Give the role
             name as "BaseIamRole" and click "Create Role".
       "key name": From EC2 dashboard, local "Key pair" in the LHS menu, towards the bottom. Create 
             key pair, give a name and download the PEM key. This can be used to login to the EC2
             instances created by Spinnaker. This will appear in Deploy pop-up, drop-down menu.
       VPCs, subnets, security groups: These need to be created manually and tagged appropriately.
             Best is to give the same tag-name to all subnets within one VPC.
       TODO/Check:
            a) IAM Actions allowed appear to be too permissive: Do we need create/DeletePolicy?
            b) Is self-refernce required if this is ONLY the target-account i.e. it is never
              "assumed" from itself? Only primary-account should need this.


Trust-relationship basics:
Use case: Party B need needs to "trust" party A.  In our case, it is ROLE
B : arn:aws:iam::<account2>:role/ROL-Spinnaker-Managed-Role (opsmx account)
A : arn:aws:iam::<account1>:role/srini-nonroot-role   (srini personal account-role)
  : arn:aws:iam::<account1>:user/srini-nonroot        (srini personal account-user)


A: Must have permission to "assume" role B. It also needs to be able to assume its own role (self-reference).
   Trust: "role" needs to "trust" the "user", in case of non-EKS
B: Must have permission to "assume" its own role((self-reference) and TRUST either the "user" (non-EKS) OR the
   "role" that A represents
